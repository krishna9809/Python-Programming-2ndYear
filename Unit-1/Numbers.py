# Python Numbers

# There are three numeric types in Python:

# 1. int
# 2. float
# 3. complex

# Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

# x = 1    # int
# y = 2.8  # float
# z = 1j   # complex


# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))

# Int
# Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.


# Example
# Integers:

# x = 1
# y = 35656222554887711
# z = -3255522

# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))


# Float
# Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

# Example
# Floats:

# x = 1.10
# y = 1.0
# z = -35.59

# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))





# Complex
# Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:

# Example
# Complex:

# x = 3+5j
# y = 5j
# z = -5j

# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))
